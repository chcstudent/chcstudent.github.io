## It's Never Dark Enough

### About Me

<p>I'm Conrad, a Computer Programming major. I've been programming off and on since high school, so I've dabbled in C++, Java, HTML/CSS, and Python. My proudest achievement to date is as a member of a small company called INDE: we have published a tabletop rpg called [Shattered](http://neverdarkenough.com/). It's a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting overrun by Lovecraftian monsters.</p>

<p>When I'm not at work as an analyst for NGA or wrestling my two boys, I'm an avid gamer, former rock climber, and occasional Audible listener. I have a love-hate relationship with LoL (y'all seen these Season 11 updates!?). Regarding Spotify, I'm on a [Sammus](http://open.spotify.com/track/4nHBK3Jv1EMSRWszFzZyNv?si=Hft1QLaXRkaDcx4zHUL0Kg) and [Sabaton](http://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX99A2f2lNH9g?si=SdM0H-GfRDmQvWtXLGbGpg) kick. </p>
