# It's Never Dark Enough

## About Me

<p>I'm Conrad, a Computer Programming major. I've been programming off and on since high school, so I've dabbled in C++, Java, HTML/CSS, and Python. My proudest achievement to date is as a member of a small company called INDE: we have published a tabletop rpg called <a href="https://neverdarkenough.com">Shattered</a>. It's a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting overrun by Lovecraftian monsters.</p>

<!-- Images of an action scene, a monster, and a playable race from the game. Should be sized so that the action shot sits above the two other images. These will be reformatted later to maintain ratio at all sizes.-->

<p>When I'm not at work as an analyst for NGA or wrestling my two boys, I'm an avid gamer, former rock climber, and occasional Audible listener. I have a love-hate relationship with LoL (y'all seen these Season 11 updates!?). Regarding Spotify, I'm on a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4nHBK3Jv1EMSRWszFzZyNv?si=Hft1QLaXRkaDcx4zHUL0Kg">Sammus</a> and <a href="http://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX99A2f2lNH9g?si=SdM0H-GfRDmQvWtXLGbGpg">Sabaton</a> kick. </p>

### Current Build

This page currently uses the Jekyll "Slate" theme, which allows the use of 'markdown' formatting for text. Three image embeds. Two link embeds.

### Intended Features

Multiple pages, with a sidebar menu connecting them all. A landing page, a page for INDE & Shattered, and add'l pages as class progresses.
