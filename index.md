  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I'm Conrad, a Computer Programming major. I've been programming off and on since high school, so I've dabbled in C++, Java, HTML/CSS, and Python. My proudest achievement to date is as a member of a small company called INDE: we have published a tabletop rpg called <a href="https://neverdarkenough.com">Shattered</a>. It's a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting overrun by Lovecraftian monsters.</p>

  <!-- Images of an action scene, a monster, and a playable race from the game. Should be sized so that the action shot sits above the two other images. These will be reformatted later to maintain ratio at all sizes.-->

  <p>When I'm not at work as an analyst for NGA or wrestling my two boys, I'm an avid gamer, former rock climber, and occasional Audible listener. I have a love-hate relationship with LoL (y'all seen these Season 11 updates!?). Regarding Spotify, I'm on a <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4nHBK3Jv1EMSRWszFzZyNv?si=Hft1QLaXRkaDcx4zHUL0Kg">Sammus</a> and <a href="http://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX99A2f2lNH9g?si=SdM0H-GfRDmQvWtXLGbGpg">Sabaton</a> kick. </p>

<h2>Current Build</h2>

<p>This page currently uses the Jekyll "Slate" theme, which allows the use of 'markdown' formatting for text. Three image embeds. Two link embeds.</p>

<h2>Intended Features</h2>

<p>5 Pages (including this one). About Us will include blurbs about the team. About the World will cover the world, the magic, and the monsters. Character Creation will cover the character sheet and what to do with it. Let's Play will cover the dice mechanics and include a video of play. The end result should look kind of like this.</p>
