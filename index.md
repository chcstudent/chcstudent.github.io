  <h2>When the World Shattered...</h2>
  <img src="/Monster%20-%20Spinewretch%20-%20Final%20-%20HR.png" alt="Spinewretch" width="360" height="450" align="right">
  <p>Humanity, at its technological peak, failed to recognize the threat of a growing religion. In the ecstatic throes of their zealotry, they committed a mass ritual-- and failed. What should have summoned their god, Ragnarok, instead sundered the world. The seas boiled away, replaced by oceans of magma. Tectonic plates sank entire cities and upbraded the surface with erratic mountain ranges. Magic and horrendous creatures of nightmare  seeped in through the cracks of reality that should have served as a portal for a mad god.</p>

  <h2>What is Shattered?</h2>

  <p><a href="https://neverdarkenough.com">Shattered</a> is a tabletop roleplaying game (like Dungeons and Dragons). This means it is best played with four or five of your friends gathered around a table with the rulebook, some dice, and snacks. In addition to the <a href="TheRules.html">rules</a>, our book also provides a detailed description of the fantastic and monster-ridden realm of <a href="TheWorld.html"><b>Feneryss</b></a>. Humanity is clustered in a few city-states, for beyond their walls no one is safe from the roving <b>Undead Tide</b>-- not to mention the innumerable other monsters that lurk just beyond that thin veil of civilization. And if the monsters don't get you, there's no guaranteeing one's safety from fellow Feneryans: pirates, slavers, and other opportunists occupy every seedy city underbelly and roam the known world.</p>
