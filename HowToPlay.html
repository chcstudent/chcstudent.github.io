<h1>How to Play</h1>

  <p> Put simply, tabletop RPGs are collaborative storytelling: the players each manage the actions and speech of a single character, and the Game Master (GM) handles everything 
    else: the other characters, setting pieces, and story elements. So how do we get there? We need to create a character, then learn how to roll the dice. </p>
  
  <h2> Creating a Character</h2>
    <img src="charsheet.png" align="right">
  <p> Creating a character starts by acquiring a <a href="http://nvrdrk.link/scfcs">character sheet</a>. Once you have a sheet, you'll need to sit down and make some decisions on
    what kind of character you want to play. Unlike most other RPGs, Shattered is a "classless" game: instead of picking a class like rogue or wizard, you gain 
    experience through gameplay that you can turn around and spend on your choice of stats, skills, and talents. Shattered is full of options in that regard: we've got talents to
    create characters proficient in swordfighting, magic, piloting airships, and even skills like armorcrafting and alchemy! Once you've built your character, it's time to get
    some dice.
  </p>
  
  <h2> Fate in Your Hands</h2>
  Like most RPGs, Shattered uses dice for confliction resolution. Whenever players attempt something in the game that has a risk of failure, they will roll dice. <i>Unlike</i>
   other RPGs, <b>Shattered</b> uses a unique die set called the Multi-Die System (MDS). By adding together your ranks in related stats and skills, you get a rating, which 
  determines which dice to roll. A rating of 1, the smallest possible rating, means the player rolls 1d4 (shorthand for 1 die that has 4 sides; 2d6 then is two dice with six 
  sides [the most common kind of die]). Each increase in rating, increases the die size: a 2 gives 1d6, a 3 is 1d8, and a rating of 4 is 1d10. At this point we introduce a 
  feature called the <b>Die Wrap</b>. At a rating of 5, you keep the 1d10 and <i>add</i> a 1d4. This new die continues to evolve like its predecessor. This continues all the way
   up to a rating of 20, which provides 5d10. This system guarantees a constant sensation of character growth. It also creates a sense of dread early on with some difficult 
  encounters being nearly impossible, with a great sense of power later as those same 'challenges' become nearly impossible to fail. 
</p>

  <h2> Getting the Gang Together</h2>
  <p> Once you and your friends have your characters ready to go, it's time to get together and play. What would that look like? Take a look!</p>
