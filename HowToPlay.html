<h1>Reading Tarot</h1>
<p>Tarot is the art of reading fortunes. Most people know this from various media as reading someone's future, but it can also be the fortune for the tarot reader, a specific event
, or a particular location. To do this, you need a tarot deck, knowledge of the cards within, a comfortable place to read them, and practice practice practice.<br>

<h3>The Deck</h3>

<p> One of the biggest barriers to entry is the daunting task of acquainting yourself with an entire deck of 78 cards, each with its own symbolism and implications. The idea can be
overwhelming, I mean: Major Arcana? Minor Arcana? Pentacles? What does it all mean?<br>
In short: The Major Arcana are the major cards or themes of a tarot reading. They represent significant figures or events regarding the target of the reading (the reader, another's
fortune, the events surrounding a particular location). All of the other cards will be associated in some way with the Major Arcana that are drawn during a reading. The Minor 
Arcana, as previously stated, are like supporting ideas, individuals, and themes. They lend context to the reading of the Major Arcana. To get better acquainted, and start your 
tarot journey, it's always good to consult <a href="biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/major-arcana">others who have already started.</a>

<h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
<p>One of the beauties of tarot (other than the cards themselves) is that anyone can learn to do it. It is recommended to do it in a quiet place where there are no distractions,
but if you get better energy from reading in a public or loud space, don't feel the need to conform. Do what feels best. The energy and your connection to the deck are crucial. 
Once you've picked a location, clarify your intent for the reading by asking (preferably out loud) a very straightforward question. "What do I need to know about my upcoming 
move?" "Why am I feeling anxious about my relationship?" "What should I focus on to improve my mental health?" Sit awhile with your hand on the deck and meditate on the target of
your reading. Think deeply on the topic for a few minutes with your hand on the deck to align yourself with it. Once you feel ready, shuffle as many times as you feel is 
appropriate. Also, you don't have to perform the stereotypical casino shuffle. Not only is it rough on the cards, but it may not be comfortable to you. Do what feels right. 
As they say, it's more art and less science.

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
There are many kinds of readings and spreads in tarot, but we're just going to talk about a simple 3-card spread. Once you've picked a topic and shuffled, it's time to read. For
your earliest readings, it may be easiest to play one a time.<br>
<b>First Card:</b> This card indicates what you can do to ease the transition or change that is occurring in your life. One of the major issues new readers run into is reading 
things too literally. As an example, if your question is, "Why am I anxious about my relationship?" and the first card drawn is Death, relax. This does NOT mean someone is going
to die. Put in context as the first card, the guiding card, Death is suggesting that you need to bring something to an end-- a certain behavior, habit, or possibly the relationship itself. 
Once you're comfortable with the possibilities presented to you through the first card, play the next card.<br>
<b>Second Card:</b> The second card should offer some guidance on addressing your personal needs in regards to the inquiry. Continuing the example, if you were to draw the Empress,
it may be that you are failing to sufficiently address your own wants and needs by putting your partner first. Consider reevaluating what you want and need from your partner. <br>
<b>Third Card:</b> The last card emphasizes something that is critical to consider. Let us say you drew the Hierophant. This may be signaling you to recenter yourself with your
spiritual beliefs: is the relationship causing you to ignore your spiritual health? Are you placing spiritual needs second to other elements in your life? Is the relationship 
contrary to your spiritual beliefs?
</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p> Once you've played all three, it's important to find the ways in which the three cards are related to one another and to contextualize them around the question. The example
given was incredibly thin, and does not take into all the possibilities that could arise in every single person's experiences. Find how it relates to your particular situation, 
and if you need help, the tarot community is a large, diverse, and helpful bunch! Below is a video for a self-reading using a 3-card spread. Happy Reading!
