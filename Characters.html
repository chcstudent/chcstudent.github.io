<h1> Creating a Character</h1>
    <img src="charsheet.png" align="right" height="auto" width="50%">
  <p> Creating a character starts by acquiring a <a href="http://nvrdrk.link/scfcs">character sheet</a>. Once you have a sheet, you'll need to sit down and make some decisions on
    what kind of character you want to play. The major decisions are Race, Stats, Skills, and Talents.
  </p>
    
    
    Unlike most other RPGs, Shattered is a "classless" game: instead of picking a class like rogue or wizard, you gain 
    experience through gameplay that you can turn around and spend on your choice of stats, skills, and talents. Shattered is full of options in that regard: we've got talents to
    create characters proficient in swordfighting, magic, piloting airships, and even skills like armorcrafting and alchemy! Once you've built your character, it's time to get
    some dice.
